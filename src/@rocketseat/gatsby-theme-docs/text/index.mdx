# Kappa Sigma Mu Fratority

Kappa Sigma Mu is a membership club using the the [Substrate Society pallet](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/v3.0.0/pallet_society/index.html). Society pallet defines most of the process behind becoming a member. New candidate members shall be judged on their ability to provide Proof-of-Ink to existing members, where the Ink shall be a permanent tattoo.

The Society is more than just the technology, it aims to make the Kusama network and its functionalities known to non-technical users, raise awareness of new forms of organization and identify the link between the onchain and offchain worlds.

The Society was founded by an anonymous single member who automatically became the original Head. The members support this anonymity as the Head shows commitment to the society by voting on new candidates (and many feel that it makes this game more interesting).

In March 2021, the KSM Society completed its first cycle of associations with 150 members admitted worldwide. We're a team of KSM members and Polkadot ambassadors working in the new brand and web portal for the society. See the [release notes](/releases) to know more about what we're doing.
