## WHAT IS KAPPA SIGMA MU?

It is a membership club using the [Substrate Society pallet](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/v3.0.0/pallet_society/index.html). Society pallet defines most of the process behind becoming a member. New candidate members shall be judged on their ability to provide Proof-of-Ink to existing members, where the Ink shall be a permanent tattoo.

Society is more than just technology. It aims to make the Kusama network and its functionalities known to non-technical users, raise awareness of new forms of organization and identify the link between the on-chain and off-chain worlds.

The Society was founded by a single anonymous member who automatically became the original Head. The members support this anonymity as the Head shows commitment to the Society by voting on new candidates (and many feel that it makes this game more interesting).

## WHAT IS THE REBRADING?

In March 2021, the KSM Society completed its first cycle of associations with 150 members admitted worldwide.

Some KSM members and Polkadot ambassadors got together to work on a new brand and web portal for the Society to deliver its initial vision.

This website is a preliminary version to show the society members the progress we did so far in the rebranding process. In the next months, we will put online a web3 portal connected with the Substrate Society pallet. See the [release notes](/releases) to know more about what we're doing.
