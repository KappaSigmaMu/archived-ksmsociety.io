In March 2021, the Kusama Society (Kappa Sigma Mu Society) completed its first cycle of associations with 150 members admitted worldwide. KSM is a membership club using the Substrate Society pallet. It aims to make Kusama and its functionalities known to non-technical users, raise awareness on new forms of organization and identify the link between the onchain and offchain worlds. New Society candidates are judged on their ability to provide proof-of-ink to existing members.

The development of the Society was planned and approved back in mid-2020. We talked to the original proponents to understand what still needs to be done. The narrative is done (first milestone) and the brand is a work in progress (second milestone), but website development has not yet started. See the [original proposal](./assets/DotsToLines-KSMSocietyCollaborationTheKusamaHumanBlockchainProject.pdf).

In this context, we propose a roadmap to address brand development, marketing strategy and website development, assembling a team to work on them.
