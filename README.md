# Website for the KappaSigmaMu Fratority

## Development

```sh
gatsby develop
```

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`

## Deploy

We use Github pages to host the application. To deploy, run:
```sh
npm run deploy
```

This command builds a static version of the application and commits it to `gh-pages` branch.
The website is hosted on https://kappasigmamu.github.io/website/
